# ROS 2 packages

This directory contains the ROS 2 packages generated by the [DSL](../ros_aml/README.MD).

## How to Launch
To launch the **generated packages** : 
1. Copy the relevant part of the generated `docker_compose.yml` in the global one [here](../docker-compose.yml)
2. Use `docker compose up -d --build` to start the containers.

## Log files

Log files are automatically generated when a Docker container id stopped.

You can find them in the `name_package/Logs` directory.
