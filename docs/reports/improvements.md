# Improvements
Several enhancements could be made like:
- Fully automated pipeline (simulations ...)
- Add monithoring (prometheus, grafana ...) for executions times, deviation from predictions, temporal drift detection
- AI model improvement : enrich features with hardware context (CPU, RAM, OS info), resource usage metrics ...
- Try / Evaluate other AI models
- DSL : add implementation for temporal constraints, implements more validations
- Predictions could be extended to the entire ROS graph or the entire nodes, rather than only individual triggers and actions (give a more global view of its temporal behavior).
- Graphical interface to generate ROS 2 packages, monitore, do the simulations ...
